VidCoder can rip Blu-rays and DVDs but does not defeat the encryption found on commercial discs. You've got several options to remove it:
* [AnyDVD HD](https://www.redfox.bz/en/anydvdhd.html) ($122, removes encryption on the fly for Blu-ray and DVD, good support for all discs)
* [Passkey for Blu-ray/DVD](https://www.dvdfab.cn/passkey-for-blu-ray.htm) ($168, removes encryption on the fly for Blu-ray and DVD, good support for all discs)
* [Passkey Lite](https://www.dvdfab.cn/passkey-lite.htm) (Free, removes encryption on the fly for Blu-ray and DVD, does *not* support all discs)
* [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) (Free, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding, supports Blu-ray and DVD)
* [libdvdcss](https://github.com/allienx/libdvdcss-dll) (Free, supports DVD only)
* [WinX DVD Ripper](https://www.winxdvd.com/) ($60, supports DVD only, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding)
